# Governments and NGOs

**Some of the benefits for governments and NGOs**

**Savings on infrastructure** - Governments and NGOs can face substantial capital expenditure to work on their own Emission reductions scheme and build a working market around that. That is where blockchain technology can help.

**Easily build emissions scheme** - Government of EL Salvador  or environmental organization can easily use BCR platform and issue their own token to be used for emission reductions. They can issue coins based on productions of renewable producers and issue these token to producers. On other hand it can issue polluters to buy these tokens in amount defined by coefficients.

For example hard coal power plant might use 10 tokens for 1 mw of power production while gas turbine power plant can use only 3 tokens. Thus producers with less emission can have advantage.

**Liquid market from day one** - Environmental organizations and governments can easily create market for tokens as these are tradable on any centralized or decentralized blockchain exchange. Tokens that were used for production will be registered back in this platform and burned so they cannot be used further.

**Huge boosts for national budget** -One of the huge advantage for these schemas is also that it generate governments budget to be used for renewables generation.

Steps might be like this:

1. Issue legal schema for polluters
2. Issue tokens and give free to tokens for renewable power producers
3. Earn money on sale of tokens to polluters.
4. Upon use of tokens burn tokes so these could be used only once&#x20;
