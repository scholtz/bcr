## How can <mark style="color:orange;">BCR</mark> help ?

&#x20;BCR is blockchain platform which helps organizations and governments issue their own carbon offset tokens for producers of clean energy. These can be used for buyers as oil, gas or chemical producers that wants to offset their carbon footprint.&#x20;

In current environment these VERs verified emissions reductions are difficult to issue and trade. This is, where our smart contracts come in handy. We help issue tokens for producers of green energy , based on government or organizations that verify standards for sustainable development.

We can imagine EL Salvador issuing their own tokens given to renewable producers based on the among of power produced. These can be bought by coal power plants , chemical plants, or gas power plants to offset their carbon footprint. There is no need to create markets or handle difficult databases, because all information is stored in blockchain and token can be traded on any centralized or decentralized exchange
